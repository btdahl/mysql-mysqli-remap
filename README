mysql-mysqli-remap.php
remapping old style mysql_-functions to corresponding mysqli_-functions
v 0.1 (alpha)

Including this file before doing any database operations should make old
mysql database operations (<= php 5.5) work with newer php (>= php 7).
Including this file in older code should be safe as well, but your mileage
may vary. All procedural. No warranty, PROVIDED AS IS. Do make db backups.
